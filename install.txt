Installation:
=============

1. copy the whole phenotype folder with all subfolders to your webserver
2. point your webroot to the htdocs folder within that folder
3. create an empty database
4. access the webroot in your browser and follow the instructions on the screen


Development:
============

To grant any user the right to access the configuration mode you must access the database, find your user
in the table users and enter the value "1" in the field usr_su. The installatio user (normally "starter")
is already a superuser.

You will find all your application files (templates, php classes) in the folder /_phenotype/application 
outside the web folder.


If you like Phenotype support us by telling the world and/or joining the community and help us with the development.

Have fun

Nils, Michel
