Attention - This beta has a Mysql dump which need a MySQL 4.1 or higher, MySQL 4.0 currently not supported


Installation:
=============

1. rename the containing folder (e.g. "phenotype_##!PT_VERSION!## _##!BUILD_NO!##") to whatever name you like
2. copy that folder to your webserver
3. point your webroot to the htdocs folder within that folder
4. create an empty database
5. access the webroot in your browser and follow the instructions on the screen


First Login:
============

Login with user "starter" and password "deleteme" and please delete or change it afterwards ... ;) backend is normally installed
in folder "_phenotype/admin".



First Demonstration:
====================

To get a first impression we recommend to install the package PT_DEMO:

1. Choose menu item "Configuration" 
2. Then click "Install package"
3. Select the  package "1200_PT_Demo"
4. Push button "Install".



Development:
============

To grant your user the right to access the configuration mode you must access the database, find your user
in the table users and enter the value "1" in the field usr_su. The user "starter" is already a superuser.



If you like Phenotype support us by telling the world and/or joining the community and help us with the development.

Have fun
